  Scaffold a new Ansible execution environment project following good
  practices. Use when the user wants to create, generate, or bootstrap
  a new EE. Use when user says "create an EE", "new execution environment",
  "scaffold EE", or "build EE project". Leverages ansible-creator when
  available. Do NOT use for building existing EEs or managing containers.

# Ansible Scaffold Execution Environment

Create a new Ansible execution environment (EE) project using
`ansible-creator` and customize it for the user's needs.

## Gather inputs

Ask the user for:
1. **EE name** — a descriptive name for the execution environment (snake_case)
   — required
2. **Target path** — where to create the EE project (default:
   `./<ee_name>`)
3. **Base image** — the container base image (default:
   `quay.io/fedora/fedora:latest`). Common choices:
   - `quay.io/fedora/fedora:latest`
   - `registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform/ee-minimal-rhel9:latest`
   - `registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform/ee-supported-rhel9:latest`
4. **ansible-core version** — pip version spec (default: `ansible-core`)
5. **Python packages** — additional Python dependencies (list)
6. **System packages** — additional system/RPM dependencies (list)
7. **Galaxy collections** — Ansible collections to include (list of
   `namespace.name` entries)
8. **Galaxy roles** — Ansible roles to include (optional list)
9. **Additional build steps** — any extra Dockerfile/Containerfile steps
   (optional)
10. **Container tags** — tags for the built image (default: `<ee_name>`)

## Dependency introspection

Before scaffolding, check if the current project contains existing Ansible
content that can inform the EE dependencies:

- **Collections** — scan for `galaxy.yml` or `collections/requirements.yml`
  in the project. If found, extract collection names and offer to include
  them automatically.
- **Roles** — scan for `roles/*/meta/main.yml` to find role dependencies
  and collections they reference.
- **Python dependencies** — scan collection and role `requirements.txt`
  files, or `setup.cfg`/`pyproject.toml` for Python dependencies used by
  custom modules or plugins.
- **System dependencies** — scan for `bindep.txt` files in collections or
  roles.

Present the discovered dependencies to the user and ask which to include.

## Scaffolding strategy

1. Run `ansible-creator init execution_env <path>` to generate the base
   skeleton. If `ansible-creator` is not installed, fall back to creating
   the directory structure manually and inform the user they can install it
   with `pip install ansible-creator` or use the `ansible-dev-tools`
   devcontainer for future use.
2. Customize `execution-environment.yml` based on user inputs.
3. Generate external dependency files (see below).
4. Update README.md with build and usage instructions.
5. Generate CI/CD pipeline if requested.

## External dependency files

For anything beyond trivial EEs, generate external dependency files instead
of inlining everything in `execution-environment.yml`. This is the
recommended pattern for maintainability.

### `requirements.yml`
Galaxy collections and roles:

```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: ansible.netcommon
    version: ">=5.0.0"
  # <user collections with optional version pins>
roles: []
  # <user roles>
```

### `requirements.txt`
Python package dependencies:

```
# Python dependencies for the execution environment
# <user python packages, one per line>
```

### `bindep.txt`
System package dependencies in bindep format:

```
# System dependencies for the execution environment
openssh-clients [platform:centos-8 platform:rhel-8 platform:rhel-9]
sshpass [platform:centos-8 platform:rhel-8 platform:rhel-9]
# <user system packages with platform selectors>
```

If the user has few dependencies, inlining is acceptable. If there are more
than 3 items in any category, use external files.

## Customization of `execution-environment.yml`

Replace the sample content with user-specified values. Reference external
dependency files when generated:

```yaml
---
version: 3

images:
  base_image:
    name: <base_image>

dependencies:
  python_interpreter:
    package_system: python3
    python_path: /usr/bin/python3

  ansible_core:
    package_pip: <ansible_core_version>

  ansible_runner:
    package_pip: ansible-runner

  system: bindep.txt

  python: requirements.txt

  galaxy: requirements.yml

additional_build_steps:
  append_base:
    - RUN $PYCMD -m pip install -U pip
    # <user additional steps>

options:
  tags:
    - <ee_name>
```

When using inline dependencies (small EEs), use the original inline format
instead of file references.

## README.md content

Generate a README with:
- EE name and purpose
- Prerequisites (`ansible-builder` installation)
- Build instructions:
  ```
  ansible-builder build -t <ee_name> -f execution-environment.yml
  ```
- Usage instructions (with `ansible-navigator`, `ansible-runner`, and
  AAP/Controller)
- Included dependencies table (collections, Python packages, system packages)
- How to customize and extend
- CI/CD pipeline description (if GitHub Actions workflow is present)

## CI/CD pipeline

If the user requested a CI/CD pipeline (ask during input gathering if not
specified), generate a pipeline to build and push the EE image.

**GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/ee-build.yml`):
- Build job: `ansible-builder build -t <ee_name> -f execution-environment.yml`
- Test job: run `ansible-navigator` with the built image to verify it works
- Push job (on tag or main branch): push to the configured registry
  using `podman push` or `docker push`
- Support for multiple registries (quay.io, ghcr.io,
  registry.redhat.io, custom)
- Use secrets for registry credentials: `REGISTRY_USERNAME`,
  `REGISTRY_PASSWORD`

**GitLab CI** (`.gitlab-ci.yml`):
- Same stages adapted to GitLab CI syntax with `$CI_REGISTRY` variables

Only generate the pipeline for the platform the user chose. Include
comments explaining required secrets and manual setup steps.

## Post-scaffold validation

After creating all files, verify:
- `execution-environment.yml` is valid YAML with version 3 schema
- All collection names use `namespace.name` format
- Base image reference is valid
- YAML uses 2-space indent and `true`/`false` booleans
- No sample/placeholder dependencies remain unless the user wanted them
- External dependency files (if generated) are referenced correctly in
  `execution-environment.yml`
- `bindep.txt` uses valid platform selectors
- README includes working build command
- CI pipeline references correct image name and registry

## Output

Report what was created:
- EE project path
- List of generated files (grouped: EE config, dependency files, CI, docs)
- The build command to run
- Any auto-detected dependencies that were included
- Any manual steps (e.g., authenticating to registries, configuring CI
  secrets, verifying bindep platform selectors)

## Rules fallback

If the rules are not available locally (no CLAUDE.md with Ansible rules or
`redhat-cop-automation-good-practices-*.md`), fetch them from
https://github.com/redhat-cop/automation-good-practices as a fallback.
